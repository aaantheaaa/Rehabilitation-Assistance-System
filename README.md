# Rehabilitation-Assistance-System

This project involves the development of a platform that aims to improve the outcome of rehabilitation programs, and assist in complementing regular visits to medical practitioners or doctors.  
The Rehabilitation Assistance System (RAS) utilises some of the latest technology in the field of IoT. This system provides a platform for doctors to communicate and assign patients appropriate exercises and monitor progress of their patients as they progress through the program. 
The RAS system uses many different technologies, such as: 
* A cloud database hosted within Australia (MongoDB) 
* A cloud hosting platform to enable high availability and speed (Heroku) 
* Implementation of sensor logic to the platform (Node-Red)
* A realtime dahsboarding software (Grafana)
* Small unintrusive, external sensors  

The team developing RAS aim to assist individuals with their rehabilitation to overall improve quality of life quicker and easier than ever.
